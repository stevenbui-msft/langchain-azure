description: Apply coding guidelines to Python test files
applyTo: tests/**/*.py

Follow the general [coding guidelines](../copilot-instructions.md) for this
project.

When making changes to the Python test code, ensure that you:

- Check `tests/**/conftest.py` files for available fixtures and utilities, and
  reuse them to avoid code duplication and inconsistencies,
- Create module-level utility functions when writing the same test logic in
  both sync and async tests, and reuse them to avoid inconsistencies in different
  test code paths,
- Unit tests must not make network calls (use `unittest.mock`), and,
- Propose running the newly created tests before submitting.
